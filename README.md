## ODH Contrib Components

Open Data Hub is an end-to-end AI/ML platform on top of OpenShift Container Platform that provides a core set of integrated components to support end end-to-end MLOps workflow for Data Scientists and Engineers. The components currently available as part of the ODH Core deployment are:


| ODH Version | Component                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1.4       | (Ray.io)[ray/README.md]                                 |
|   1.4       | (Pachyderm)[odhpachyderm/README.md]                     |
|   1.4       | (Superset)[superset/README.md]                          |
|   1.3       | (ArgoWorkflows)[odhargo/README.md]                      |
|   1.3       | (Hue)[hue/README.md]                                    |
|   1.3       | (Hive Thrift Server)[thriftserver/README.md]            |
|   1.3       | (Trino)[trino/README.md]                                |
|   1.3       | (Radanalytics Spark Operator)[radanalyticsio/README.md] |


Any components that were removed with the update to ODH 1.4 have been relocated to the [ODH Contrib](https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib) organization under the [odh-contrib-manifests](https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib/odh-contrib-manifests) repo.  You can reference the [odh-contrib kfdef](kfdef/odh-contrib.yaml) as a reference on how to deploy any of the odh-contrib-manifests components

## Deploy

We are relying on [Kustomize v3](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize), [kfctl](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl) and [Open Data Hub Operator](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator/blob/master/operator.md) for deployment.

The two ways to deploy are:

1. Following [Getting Started](http://opendatahub.io/docs/getting-started/quick-installation.html) guide using a KFDef from this repository as the custom resource.
1. Using `kfctl` and follow the documentation at [Kubeflow.org](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/openshift/). The only change is to use this repository instead of Kubeflow manifests.
